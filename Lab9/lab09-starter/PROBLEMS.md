# Lab 09: Maps and Balanced Trees

In this lab, you will complete two map implementations.

Feel free to put whatever you want in App#main for experimentation.

## Problems

**Problem 1. WordCount**

Complete the code in WordCount.java to determine word counts for the
provided text files using the supplied TreeMap implementation.

Look for TODO comments as a starting point for where to make changes.
Remove the TODO comment once you've done it.

It might be useful to add a helper method that gets the old count
for a word from the map and inserts one more than that value.


**Problem 2. ConsMap**

Complete the code in ConsMap.java to build a Map data structure using
a ConsList.

Your list will contain key value pairs. Most operations involve searching
the list for an Entry where the key equals the key you're looking for.

Again, look for TODO comments, and remove them once you've done the
thing.


**Problem 3. Scapegoat Tree**

Modify the code in TreeMap.java to keep the tree balanced using the
Scapegoat Tree strategy.
